# Feedback

## Project Workflow

**Exceeds Expecations**

Very impressed with your planning process! While you originally had a very large scope, liked how you were able to cut down and get your MVP! I'm sure if you had to do it over again you would spend more time orginally thinking about your features wish-list, and what models/relatioships would be necessary to implement them. Great `readme`, really like how you document your plans, and heres to hoping you get to those gold user stories!

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

Nice job implementing user authentication, and user authentication, think you've identified some low-hanging fruit there! Really liked how you adjusted on the fly with setting up your associations, I'm confident you know have the practice and tools to tackle the next set up of models, associations for your next features. Would to see you keep working on this to add some more features/external technologies.

## Creativity / Interface

**Meets Expectations**

Really like how you went out a built an app to solve a problem that's personal and applicable for you!  What are some of the next steps to build on this work? How could you make the app more social for users, or what would it take to set up matches, and brackets for tournaments? Overall, this app's design and interface really fit well with the purpose/functionality, but know you have plans to add to what you have already.
